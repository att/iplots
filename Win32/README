iPlots eXtreme for Windows make use of the FreeType library to render
text. FreeType is available from http://www.freetype.org/

Due to the complications involved in building FreeType binary and the
general unavailability of such static build, this directory contains a
full, static build of FreeType 2.4.6 library using Rtools 2.13
toolchain for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. Since iPlots eXtreme are
licensed under GPLv2 that makes those binaries also licensed under
GPLv2 (otherwise FreeType has a choice of licenses).

In order to build FreeType on Windows using the above toolchain, the
"config.mk" file was created with the following content:

include $(TOP_DIR)/builds/ansi/ansi-def.mk
include $(TOP_DIR)/builds/compiler/gcc.mk
include $(TOP_DIR)/builds/link_std.mk

and the 32-bit build built simply by running "make"

For the 64-bit build the file "builds/compiler/gcc.mk" was modified
by replacing the line
CC           := gcc
with
CC           := x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc

and the resulting libfreetype.a was post-processed by running
x86_64-w64-mingw32-ranlib libfreetype.a

The FreeType sources are available from the FreeType website and
alternatively also from iPlots eXtreme files section on RForge.net:
